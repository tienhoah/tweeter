# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single AJAX page Twitter clone using jQuery, HTML5 and plain CSS3.
This is built up from a skeleton page with some set up from back-end server side.
So bootcamp student as myself can focus on the front-end chops with those above technologies.
This is built responsively with different types of device and also accessible outside from deployment with Heroku.

## Final Product
